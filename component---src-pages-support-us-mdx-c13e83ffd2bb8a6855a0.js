However, the infrastructure required to keep it running has a monthly cost, which I have been covering for the past three years (The cost is not very high, but it adds up over time). To keep the API available, I enabled multiple support alternatives where you can contribute to help cover the monthly expenses ✨ The availability of the service will depend on the support we receive. I appreciate your use of the API and hope that you can contribute to keeping it available 💖")))}t.default=function(e){void 0===e&&(e={});const{wrapper:t}=Object.assign({},(0,o.RP)(),e.components);return t?r.createElement(t,e,r.createElement(i,e)):i(e)}},8453:function(e,t,n){n.d(t,{RP:function(){return a},xA:function(){return l}});var o=n(6540);const r=o.createContext({});function a(e){const t=o.useContext(r);return o.useMemo((()=>"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}),[t,e])}const i={};function l({components:e,children:t,disableParentContext:n}){let l;return l=n?"function"==typeof e?e({}):e||i:a(e),o.createElement(r.Provider,{value:l},t)}}}]);
