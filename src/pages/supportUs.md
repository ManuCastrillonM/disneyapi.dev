**Important note**
_Hello friends 👋 I developed this project in my free time, and the use of it is (and will continue to be) completely free. However, the infrastructure required to keep it running has a monthly cost, which I have been covering for the past three years (The cost is not very high, but it adds up over time). To keep the API available, I enabled multiple support alternatives where you can contribute to help cover the monthly expenses ✨ The availability of the service will depend on the support we receive. I appreciate your use of the API and hope that you can contribute to keeping it available 💖_
